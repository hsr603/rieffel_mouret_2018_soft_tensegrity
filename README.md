Code for the paper "Adaptive and Resilient Soft Tensegrity Robots" (Rieffel &amp; Mouret, 2018, Soft Robotics)

This code uses an old version of limbo (16731119224a57d6f100c699c039c631d04d0a13), our Bayesian optimization library. It will probably not compile with the last version (but if you want to follow up on this work, you should port it to the new version).
